# 04 - AI Classification System

## Overview
Implement AI-powered email classification using LLM APIs and clustering algorithms for intelligent email organization.

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Set up LLM API integration (OpenAI/Claude)
- [ ] Build email clustering functionality
- [ ] Create user feedback learning system
- [ ] Implement classification confidence scoring

## Files to Create

### Backend Files
- `backend/app/models/classification.py` - Classification results model
- `backend/app/services/llm_client.py` - LLM API wrapper
- `backend/app/services/email_classifier.py` - Email classification service
- `backend/app/services/email_clustering.py` - Clustering algorithms
- `backend/app/api/classification_routes.py` - Classification endpoints
- `tests/test_classification.py` - Classification tests

### Configuration Files
- `backend/app/config/classification_prompts.py` - LLM prompts
- `backend/app/config/categories.py` - Email categories definition

## Key Implementation Points

### LLM Integration
- Support for OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude APIs
- Structured prompts for consistent classification
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Cost monitoring and usage limits
- Fallback strategies for API failures

### Email Categories
- Important (work, personal urgent)
- Promotional (marketing, deals)
- Social (social media, forums)
- Newsletter (subscriptions, updates)
- Spam (unwanted, suspicious)
- Personal (friends, family)

### Clustering Algorithm
- K-means clustering on email content
- TF-IDF vectorization for text features
- Optimal cluster number determination
- Cluster labeling and interpretation

### Feedback Learning
- Store user corrections and preferences
- Update classification prompts based on feedback
- Track accuracy improvements over time
- Personalized classification models

## Tips
- Use structured JSON responses from LLMs
- Implement prompt engineering best practices
- Cache classification results to reduce API costs
- Use scikit-learn for clustering algorithms
- Add confidence thresholds for uncertain classifications
