# 06 - Bulk Email Operations

## Overview
Implement safe bulk operations for email management with AI recommendations, progress tracking, and rollback capabilities.

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Implement bulk action processing with Celery
- [ ] Build recommendation engine for email actions
- [ ] Add progress tracking and status updates
- [ ] Create undo functionality for operations

## Files to Create

### Backend Files
- `backend/app/models/bulk_operation.py` - Bulk operation tracking model
- `backend/app/services/bulk_processor.py` - Bulk operation service
- `backend/app/services/recommendation_engine.py` - AI recommendation service
- `backend/app/tasks/bulk_tasks.py` - Celery background tasks
- `backend/app/api/bulk_routes.py` - Bulk operation endpoints
- `tests/test_bulk_operations.py` - Bulk operation tests

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/components/BulkActions.tsx` - Bulk action interface
- `frontend/src/components/ProgressTracker.tsx` - Progress tracking component

## Key Implementation Points

### Bulk Operations
- Delete emails (move to trash)
- Archive emails (remove from inbox)
- Apply labels/categories
- Mark as read/unread
- Move to folders
- Export email data

### Safety Features
- Preview mode before execution
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Operation logging and audit trail
- Rollback capabilities within time window
- Progress tracking with cancellation

### Recommendation Engine
- AI-powered suggestions for email actions
- Confidence scoring for recommendations
- User preference learning
- Batch recommendation processing
- Custom rule creation

### Background Processing
- Celery tasks for long-running operations
- Progress updates via WebSocket or polling
- Error handling and retry logic
- Resource usage monitoring
- Queue management

## Tips
- Use database transactions for atomic operations
- Implement proper error handling and rollback
- Add rate limiting to prevent Gmail API abuse
- Use WebSockets for real-time progress updates
- Store operation metadata for analytics
