# 11 - Deployment and Infrastructure

## Overview
Configure Docker containerization and AWS infrastructure for scalable deployment with monitoring, logging, and CI/CD pipeline.

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Set up Docker containerization
- [ ] Deploy to AWS infrastructure
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Files to Create

### Docker Configuration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Backend container configuration
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Frontend container configuration
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production Docker Compose
- `.dockerignore` - Docker ignore patterns
- `nginx/nginx.conf` - Reverse proxy configuration

### AWS Infrastructure
- `infrastructure/terraform/` - Infrastructure as Code
- `infrastructure/cloudformation/` - AWS CloudFormation templates
- `infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh` - Deployment scripts
- `infrastructure/config/` - Environment configurations

### CI/CD Pipeline
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Testing workflow
- `scripts/build.sh` - Build automation script
- `scripts/health-check.sh` - Health check script

### Monitoring and Logging
- `monitoring/prometheus.yml` - Metrics configuration
- `monitoring/grafana/` - Dashboard configurations
- `logging/fluentd.conf` - Log aggregation configuration

## Docker Configuration

### Backend Dockerfile
- Multi-stage build for optimization
- Python dependencies installation
- Security best practices
- Health check endpoints
- Non-root user execution

### Frontend Dockerfile
- Node.js build environment
- Static file serving with Nginx
- Build optimization
- Security headers
- Gzip compression

### Production Considerations
- Environment variable management
- Secret management
- Resource limits and requests
- Restart policies
- Network configuration

## AWS Infrastructure

### Core Services
- **ECS Fargate** - Container orchestration
- **Application Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution
- **RDS PostgreSQL** - Managed database
- **ElastiCache Redis** - Caching and task queue
- **S3** - Static file storage
- **CloudFront** - CDN for frontend assets

### Security Configuration
- **VPC** - Network isolation
- **Security Groups** - Firewall rules
- **IAM Roles** - Service permissions
- **Secrets Manager** - Credential storage
- **Certificate Manager** - SSL/TLS certificates

### Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch** - Metrics and logs
- **X-Ray** - Distributed tracing
- **CloudTrail** - API audit logging
- **SNS** - Alert notifications

## Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Quick rollback capability
- Traffic switching strategy
- Database migration handling

### Environment Management
- Development environment
- Staging environment
- Production environment
- Feature branch deployments

### Database Migrations
- Automated migration scripts
- Rollback procedures
- Data backup before migrations
- Migration testing strategy

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Build Stage
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Unit and integration tests
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Docker image building and pushing

### Deploy Stage
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Application deployment
- Database migrations
- Health checks and validation

### Monitoring Stage
- Deployment success verification
- Performance monitoring
- Error rate monitoring
- Rollback triggers

## Performance Optimization

### Backend Optimization
- Database query optimization
- API response caching
- Connection pooling
- Resource usage monitoring

### Frontend Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Asset optimization and compression
- CDN configuration
- Browser caching strategies

### Infrastructure Optimization
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Load balancer optimization
- Database performance tuning
- Cost optimization strategies

## Security Considerations

### Application Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### Infrastructure Security
- Network security groups
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Access logging and monitoring

## Tips
- Use infrastructure as code for reproducibility
- Implement proper secret management
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Test deployment procedures in staging
- Document rollback procedures
- Monitor costs and optimize resource usage
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
