# 05 - Spam Detection and Sender Management

## Overview
Implement intelligent spam detection using LLM APIs and build sender flagging system for automatic spam prevention.

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Implement spam detection algorithms
- [ ] Build sender management system
- [ ] Create automatic flagging for repeat offenders
- [ ] Add whitelist/blacklist functionality

## Files to Create

### Backend Files
- `backend/app/models/sender.py` - Sender tracking model
- `backend/app/services/spam_detector.py` - Spam detection service
- `backend/app/services/sender_manager.py` - Sender management service
- `backend/app/api/spam_routes.py` - Spam detection endpoints
- `tests/test_spam_detection.py` - Spam detection tests

### Configuration Files
- `backend/app/config/spam_patterns.py` - Known spam patterns
- `backend/app/config/spam_prompts.py` - LLM prompts for spam detection

## Key Implementation Points

### Spam Detection Features
- Content analysis using LLM APIs
- Sender reputation tracking
- Pattern recognition for common spam
- Confidence scoring for spam likelihood
- Explanation generation for flagged emails

### Sender Management
- Track sender behavior patterns
- Automatic flagging based on spam history
- User-controlled whitelist/blacklist
- Sender reputation scoring
- Domain-level analysis

### Detection Criteria
- Suspicious subject lines
- Promotional language patterns
- Unknown or suspicious senders
- Unusual sending patterns
- Links to suspicious domains
- Attachment analysis

## Tips
- Use specialized spam detection prompts for LLMs
- Implement sender reputation algorithms
- Add manual review capabilities for edge cases
- Consider domain reputation services
- Track false positive rates for improvement
