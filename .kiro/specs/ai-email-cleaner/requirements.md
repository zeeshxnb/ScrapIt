# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Email Cleaner is a web-based application that connects to email inboxes to automatically clean, delete, sort, and organize thousands of emails using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The system will provide an intuitive web interface for users to manage their email cleanup process and includes automated spam detection capabilities. This project serves as a comprehensive data science and computer science portfolio piece, incorporating multiple modern technologies and methodologies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my email inbox to the web application, so that the system can access and analyze my emails for cleaning and organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web application THEN the system SHALL provide Google OAuth authentication for Gmail access
2. WHEN a user authenticates with Google THEN the system SHALL securely store access credentials using OAuth 2.0 and Gmail API
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL display the total number of emails accessible
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI system to automatically categorize and sort my emails, so that I can quickly identify important messages and reduce inbox clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes emails THEN it SHALL use LLM APIs (OpenAI/Claude) to classify them into categories (Important, Promotional, Social, Spam, Newsletter, Personal)
2. WHEN categorization is complete THEN the system SHALL use clustering algorithms to group similar emails for folder organization
3. WHEN a user reviews categorized emails THEN they SHALL be able to approve or correct the AI's decisions
4. WHEN corrections are made THEN the system SHALL store feedback to improve future classifications through prompt engineering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically identify and flag spam emails and senders, so that I can protect my inbox from unwanted messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes emails THEN it SHALL analyze sender patterns, content, and metadata to identify spam
2. WHEN spam is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the email and sender with a confidence score
3. WHEN a sender is flagged as spam THEN the system SHALL automatically flag future emails from that sender
4. WHEN spam detection occurs THEN the system SHALL provide explanations for why emails were flagged
5. IF a user marks a flagged email as legitimate THEN the system SHALL update its spam detection model

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to bulk delete or archive emails based on AI recommendations, so that I can quickly clean up thousands of emails efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL recommend emails for deletion, archiving, or keeping
2. WHEN recommendations are displayed THEN users SHALL be able to review them before taking action
3. WHEN a user approves bulk actions THEN the system SHALL execute them safely with rollback capability
4. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and completion summaries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see analytics and insights about my email patterns, so that I can understand my email usage and the effectiveness of the cleaning process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate visualizations of email volume over time
2. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL show sender frequency, category distributions, and spam detection rates
3. WHEN cleanup operations are performed THEN the system SHALL track and display space saved and emails processed
4. WHEN viewing insights THEN users SHALL be able to export reports in common formats (PDF, CSV)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to showcase multiple data science and computer science technologies, so that it serves as a comprehensive portfolio project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL utilize Python backend with LLM APIs for email classification
2. WHEN building the backend THEN it SHALL implement clustering algorithms and natural language processing for content analysis
3. WHEN creating the frontend THEN it SHALL use a modern web framework optimized for rapid development
4. WHEN storing data THEN it SHALL implement SQL database for structured data and user feedback
5. WHEN deploying THEN it SHALL use AWS cloud services and Docker containerization for scalability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the project to be completed within a one-week timeline and work at small scale, so that it serves as a functional MVP for friends and portfolio purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning the project THEN it SHALL be scoped for completion within one week of development time
2. WHEN building features THEN they SHALL prioritize core functionality over advanced features
3. WHEN testing the system THEN it SHALL handle small-scale usage among friends (10-100 users)
4. WHEN containerizing THEN it SHALL use Docker for consistent development and deployment environments
